    <h1> Welcome to Christoff Connor Carty Portfolio Webpage</h1>
    <p>  Hey everyone my name is Christoff Connor Carty and I'm 19 years old. I'm a sophomore and I'm pursuing a BA in computer science here at URI.
	 I was born in Providence Rhode Island but raised in the Caribbean on a small island called Anguilla. I've been back and forth between the islands and the US since I was nine when I made my first visit to Providence.<br>
	    In my free time, I love to play basketball and go to the gym. When I'm not exercising I like to watch movies, anime, and MMA.
	    Over the summer I worked on ferry and charter boats on the islands and after college, I'd like to start my own charter boat business. <br>
	   I love to be on the ocean and hopefully, one day am able to captain a vessel of my own.

</p>
